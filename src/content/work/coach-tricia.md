## Coach Tricia Rago: Healing Hearts, Empowering Futures

Navigating the turbulent waters of a breakup can be incredibly challenging.  It's a time of emotional upheaval, self-doubt, and often, a feeling of being lost.  Tricia Rago is a breakup coach specializing in unconscious uncoupling, guiding individuals through the healing process and empowering them to create a brighter future.

### A Unique Vision, A Collaborative Design

Tricia approached me with a vision: to create a website that not only showcased her coaching services but also reflected her unique approach to healing and empowerment.  We worked closely together, collaborating on every aspect of the design and development, to bring her vision to life.


### Built with Simplicity and Purpose

The website is built using:

* **Astro:**  A modern web framework that allows for fast and efficient website performance.
* **JavaScript:**  Used for interactive elements and enhancing the user experience.
* **CSS:**  For styling and creating a visually appealing and supportive design.

### Why Unconscious Uncoupling?

Unconscious uncoupling is a powerful approach to navigating breakups.  It focuses on understanding the underlying patterns and dynamics that contributed to the relationship's end, allowing individuals to heal deeply and break free from repeating negative cycles in future relationships.  Tricia's coaching helps clients:

* **Understand Their Patterns:**  Identify and understand the unconscious patterns that may have played a role in the breakup.
* **Heal and Grow:**  Process emotions, heal from past hurts, and develop self-awareness.
* **Create a Brighter Future:**  Move forward with confidence and create healthier, more fulfilling relationships.
