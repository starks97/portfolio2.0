### The first time I tried to code, I failed spectacularly—and it changed everything.

When a friend casually asked, "Can you help me build a website?" I didn’t realize that simple question would redirect my entire career. At the time, I didn’t know how to do it, but I said yes anyway—launching me into the most frustrating and rewarding journey of my life.

My path to that moment had already crossed continents. After moving from Ecuador to Spain and back, I’d studied Civil Engineering while secretly craving more creative problem-solving. The leap to America became my chance to start fresh—teaching myself English through late-night study sessions while working whatever jobs I could find.

Each challenge, from language barriers to financial struggles, became proof that I could teach myself anything with enough determination.

That first website project should have taken an experienced developer hours. It took me weeks. I still remember the exact moment my broken JavaScript function finally worked—that rush of triumph when the pieces clicked together.

What surprised me wasn’t just that I’d solved it, but how much I’d enjoyed the struggle. The late-night debugging sessions, the Stack Overflow deep dives, the constant cycle of breaking and fixing—I was hooked.

Now I understand what captivated me: coding is the perfect intersection of logic and creativity. My background gives me unique advantages—the adaptability from navigating cultures, the grit from overcoming language barriers, and the problem-solving instincts honed through constant self-teaching.

I don’t just write code; I build solutions informed by a life of unconventional challenges.

Here’s what excites me now: Finding a team that values perspective as much as technical skills. Somewhere my journey from "I don’t know how to build this" to "Let me figure it out" isn’t just a story—it’s exactly the mindset they need.

I want to contribute that same determination to meaningful projects and to keep growing alongside engineers who care about building things that matter.

### So tell me—what problems should we solve together?
