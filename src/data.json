It's the soundtrack to feeling like you just closed a massive deal (even if it's just a pull request). The subconscious association with success fuels the drive to conquer coding challenges, while the right tunes surprisingly sharpen focus and boost creative thinking. Basically, it's positive reinforcement on repeat, because who *doesn't* want to feel like they're closing deals while they're coding?",
